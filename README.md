# üß† Stroke Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project uses supervised machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of a stroke in a patient based on health and lifestyle factors. The dataset used is the Stroke Prediction Dataset from Kaggle, which includes features such as age, gender, hypertension, heart disease, smoking status, and more.

The goal is to build an accurate classification model that can assist in early stroke detection and prevention by analyzing key risk indicators. The workflow includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and optional deployment.

## üìä Dataset Information
- Source: [Kaggle - Stroke Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset)
- Type: Tabular data
- Records: ~5,000
- Target: `stroke` (0 = No Stroke, 1 = Stroke)

## ‚úÖ Project Steps
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering
- Encoding & Scaling
- Model Building (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
- Evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, AUC-ROC)
- Optional: Streamlit Web App Deployment

## üß∞ Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## üîç Objective
To develop a reliable and interpretable machine learning model that helps identify high-risk stroke patients early using accessible data.
